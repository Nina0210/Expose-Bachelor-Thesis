    abstract = {We discuss some simple theoretical properties of web page ranking distributions, including PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), which are based on uniformly ergodic Markov chains. We also propose a modiÔ¨Åcation of PageRank whith reduces the bias for older documents, and discuss details of our simulation programs.},
