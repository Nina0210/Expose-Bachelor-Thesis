    abstract = {We consider the PageRank problem in the dynamic setting, where the goal is to explicitly maintain an approximate PageRank vector π ∈ Rn for a graph under a sequence of edge insertions and deletions. Our main result is a complete characterization of the complexity of dynamic PageRank maintenance for both multiplicative and additive (L1) approximations.},
